Conclusion  \nThe data was separated into 10 clusters using a k-means clustering algorithm.  \nUnfortunetly all the data was ultimately separated into two clusters.  \nWhile this narrows down the search by half when looking to settle into Vancouver, this is still too large of an area.  \nThe k-means needs to be refined to provide more granular data. This is only a starting point for narrowing down a search."
